# Description

Autopanic is a minimalist twinstick shooter attempting to deliver a fully diegetic gameplay that acknowledges every player action. Some Rogue-like elements are added to the mix as well.

# History

Autopanic started out as a small shoot 'em up in 2020, later evolved into more of a Rogue-like because scope creep must happen for every developer.

# Features

- A variety of abilities and weapons for you to combine and dominate the fast-paced combat.
- Randomized layout that will challenge your skills and knowledge.
- Minimalist visual style.
- A design choice that acknowledges every player action.
