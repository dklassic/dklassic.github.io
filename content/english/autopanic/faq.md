*Last Updated April 3, 2023:* Here are answers to frequently asked questions about my first game, ***Autopanic***!

# What is *Autopanic*?

***Autopanic*** is fully diegetic twinstick shooter with rogue-like elements in which you need to follow the guidance of an AI to reach the top floor of a mysteries facility. ***Autopanic*** is intentionally designed to be a freeing experience where the player can learn the world at their own pace. I aim to deliver a game with some interesting narrative design along with satisfying fast-paced combat.

# Where can I get *Autopanic*?

***Autopanic*** will soon be available on:

- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1274830)


# What are the PC versions' minimum system requirements?

For PC, the lowest spec machine tested sports an Intel i5-8400 + RX470 combination and can run 1080p/60fps consistently. In addition, I've made sure Steam Deck can run the game at a consistent 800p/60fps, and can have a decent enough 90fps gameplay experience if you want.

It can go a lot lower if you’re willing to run it at even lower resolution, engage lower FPS cap, and even lowering the visual quality.

# Does *Autopanic* have PC controller support?

Yes! The game automatically work with any controller thrown at it. If not? That’s probably Unity’s fault. You can also toggle on/off Steam Input, both of which might lead to a proper detection of controller input.

# What languages does the game support?

***Autopanic*** features English and Traditional Chinese interface/subtitle, more language support is planned but will definitely take some time because I hope all languages to be written natively instead of being a plain translation.

<!-- If you’re interested in making unofficial language mod, you can refer to here for more information. -->

<!-- # I love the music in your games. Is the *Autopanic* soundtrack available?

You can look it up at YouTube for free or buy the Naumi's Endgame DLC to get access to high quality audio files. -->

# Does *Autopanic* support PC cloud saves?

Yes! ***Autopanic*** supports cloud saves on Steam. You may also find local copies of your saves under Documents\Saved Games\Autopanic.

<!-- # I ran into a technical issue with the game. What should I do?

If you need technical support, please have a look in [Autopanic Tech Fixes]({{< ref "/autopanic/tech-fixes" >}}). If the problem still hasn't been resolved, you can find help in [Autopanic Steam Technical Support forum](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1274830/discussions/3/) or in the official Discord server `#autopaniczero-tech-support` channel, which should help get you sorted. -->

# What does fully diegetic mean, anyway...?

All elements shown in Autopanic are in-universe without exception.

# And you said there are Rogue-like elements?

Each attempt will feature different layout, enemy composition, and whatever rewards you can find.

I wouldn’t dare say this is a full-blown Rogue-like but there should be enough stuffs around for you to enjoy!

<!-- # Now that *Autopanic* has launched, what's next?

I need to rest. Seriously.

Then maybe one day I’ll make another game. -->

# Who are you, again...?

I’m DK Liao, a developer from Taiwan!

I studied Chemical Engineering and Information Management. I’m extremely interested in Operation Research and Theory of Computation. And I’ve worked as video editor and translator at Ubisoft’s local branch for around six years.

I figure with all the things I’ve learnt, game development is the only choice to make them all shine! So here I am!

# How long was *Autopanic* in development?

The first prototype of Autopanic is finished in April 2020. The actual development started at May 1st 2020. The project was put on hold several times but three years of development should be accurate enough. If you're interested, I've keep tabs on my development for the most part [here](https://blog.chosenconcept.dev/tags/autopanic/) on this little site of mine.

# Is *Autopanic* a multiplayer game, or are there any plans for multiplayer?

***Autopanic*** is a single-player game. I initially have some idea for a couch coop mode, but that end up being scrapped, for now. The gameplay and narrative of ***Autopanic*** has always been designed with a solo experience in mind anyways.

# Does *Autopanic* include DRM of any kind?

Nope, you can copy the folder anywhere and it should still work!
