It is January 2021, my three-month project has stretched into 8 months and I'm not anywhere near the finish line. Actually, I'm not getting anywhere.
But I'm much wiser now, armed with some actual proper game development knowledge and starting to get a grip of what Unity can do properly.

By what Unity can do, I mean it can't do anything. So no more hacking with existing solutions, I must get my hands dirty and start building reliable stuffs. Everything by myself from ground up, so I can know its limitation and know how to expand and fix it.

I decided to build some proper backbone for the project to go forward then grant myself some much needed rest. So I started building:

- Enemy AI
- Level Management Tool
- UI Framework

I'll have to start talking from UI though.
