Following the minor burnout and finally cleaning up lose ends and laid out some great foundation, I took a three month break to do something else. Like making more games.

# Enemy Within

I made a small game about card. Quickly hacked together nice looking setup with HDRP example scene and had some physics fun.

# Taipei Bus Rush

There's this long running joke about bus drivers are driving as if they're racing in Taipei. Only that it is not actually a joke.

Anyways. I then made a game about roaming around Open Street Map generated Taipei with a bus. Collecting passengers at bus station then boost by throwing passengers out. I tried to generate all the racing course with existing bus route. Fun one.

But then I thought I found a gold mine: Tokyo's OSM marking is surprisingly robust, what if I can generate the whole city then make some quick bucks?
