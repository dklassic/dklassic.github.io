Prototype

April 2020, inspired by A Short Hike, I decided to start learning how to making my own game. I started with Sebastian Lague's Twinstick Shooter Tutorial and quickly build up something almost enjoyable:

And made a Reddit post to brag about it

I also accidentally let the projectiles knockback my shooter enemy, resulting in some cool Shoot & Retreat moment.
I think to myself, wow, seven days and it is already fun. No doubt I can make a game!

So I initially planned the game as a shoot 'em up, and the plan is to finish the game in May 2020.
Looking back, that was definitely possible, just not for me back in 2020.
