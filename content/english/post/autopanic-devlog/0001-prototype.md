# Prototype

April 2020, inspired by A Short Hike, I decided to start learning how to making my own game. I started with [Sebastian Lague's Twinstick Shooter Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0ctd4dgE1F8g3uec4zKNRV0) and quickly build up something almost enjoyable:

And [made a Reddit post to brag about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/fwgt8o/day_7_in_my_twin_stick_shooter_attempt).

I also accidentally let the projectiles knockback my shooter enemy, resulting in some cool Shoot & Retreat moment.

I think to myself, wow, seven days and it is already fun. No doubt I can make a game!

So I initially planned the game as a shoot 'em up, and the plan is to finish the game in May 2020.

Looking back, that was definitely possible, just not for me back in 2020.
