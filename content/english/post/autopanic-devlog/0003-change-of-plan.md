Because of course there's a scope creep for every beginner's project.

I thought to myself that a game about clearing hordes is not going to sell in 2020, which is later proven wrong by recent success of Vampire survivor. (Had some fun revisiting this idea, but that's for later)

And my initial design revolves around player having an ability to run faster than enemies, which of course makes player completely invincible. So I thought to myself that I need a smaller level. For god knows what reason it never occurs to me that I can add a stamina system which surely works well in [Jakob Wahlberg](https://twitter.com/Jakob_Wahlberg)'s project GoMechaBall.

Twinstick shooter in small rooms. Time to build a Rogue-like dungeon crawler of sorts.
