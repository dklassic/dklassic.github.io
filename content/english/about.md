Hey there! I'm DK Liao (廖得凱).

I've been in game industry for quite a while but haven't involved in the Development side at all. So I figure it would be cool if I can make my own game.

Currently developing two games at once:

- [Autopanic](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1274830/_/), a minimalist twinstick shooter with Rogue like elements
    - An experimental project that attempts to make a fully diegetic game
- [Autopanic Zero](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1423670/_/), a minimalist twinstick shooter survival game 
    - Inspired by Vampire Survivor and Armored Core
