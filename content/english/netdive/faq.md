*Last Updated July 10, 2025:* Here are answers to frequently asked questions about my game, ***NetDive***!

# What is *NetDive* about?


# Where can I get *NetDive*?

***NetDive*** will soon be available on:

- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3718870/)

# What are the minimum system requirements?

Let's just say if you got a computer more powerful than Steam Deck you'll be running it just fine.

For Steam Deck the game targets 800p/90FPS.

# Does *NetDive* have PC controller support?

Controller, Mouse Only, Keyboard Only. Your pick!

A bit unfortunate that I had to resort to partial cursor input for Controller but I don't really have a better option so there you go.

# Does *NetDive* support PC cloud saves?

Yes it does! You may also find local copies of your saves under `Documents/Saved Games/NetDive`.

# I ran into a technical issue with the game. What should I do?

If you need technical support, please have a look in [NetDive Tech Fixes]({{< ref "/netdive/tech-fixes" >}}). If the problem still hasn't been resolved, you can seek help in [NetDive Technical Support forum](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1423670/discussions/1/), which should help get you sorted.


# Can I play it as an Idler?

Yes you can! Just go to input option menu and toggle on that Auto Move option.

# So that’s it for the *NetDive* FAQ?

That’s all of it! Thanks for reading ;)
