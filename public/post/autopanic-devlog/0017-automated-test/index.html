<h1 id="auto-tester">Auto Tester <a href="#auto-tester" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>I first have the idea of automated testing since my revamp of player and enemy code base. Although still separated, a lot of the designs for player and enemy were structured to be similar. I quite fascinated by some automation test talks from GDC, and figure it should be extremely useful for my game to have one. Though I never went the extra mile to setup an automated test, my later systems are often written with automated tests in mind.</p>
<p>Fast forward to me making a spinoff project, I only want to hack together something somewhat enjoyable as fast a possible. But Survivor-like gameplay takes quite some effort both physically and mentally to play through, and it is also extremely time consuming to do playtest myself. I&rsquo;m not quite ready to lose my friends to an unbalanced gameplay so I decided it&rsquo;s time to deploy an automated tester.</p>
<h1 id="auto-tester-for-autopanic-zero">Auto Tester for Autopanic Zero <a href="#auto-tester-for-autopanic-zero" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p><p class="markdown-image">
  
  <img src="/images/posts/autopanic-devlog/0017/3.gif" alt="Auto Tester for Autopanic Zero"  / class="medium-zoom-image">
</p></p>
<p>Automated tester for Autopanic Zero is pretty rudimentary. All it does is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always target nearest enemy</li>
<li>Having a preferred distance from target</li>
<li>Shoot constantly</li>
<li>Initially dash whenever available, I later make it assess how surrounded it is to trigger the dash</li>
</ul>
<p>But it is already useful enough to validate the general balance before I had to dive in and check the experience in depth. This helped me focusing on broad strokes when tweaking my game instead of burying myself in details.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m quite happy with the results. Still, there&rsquo;s only combat in Zero which makes it trivial to implement, but Autopanic has much more interactions to consider.</p>
<h1 id="a-detour-at-sigono">A detour at Sigono <a href="#a-detour-at-sigono" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>For some reason I have the privilege to work in Sigono, the studio behind the excellent OPUS: Echo of Starsong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been helping to port the game to iOS and to save performance in a finished product without full picture of the code base is a trial and error effort. Thankfully they have a automated testing system with automated screen recording which helped me check the result of my tweak without me having to play through the whole game.</p>
<p>Their automated system more than once saved my ass, and solidifies my desire to finally implement automated tester in Autopanic.</p>
<h1 id="auto-tester-for-autopanic">Auto Tester for Autopanic <a href="#auto-tester-for-autopanic" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>So automated tester in Autopanic is deployed to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear an encounter</li>
<li>Reach reward and claim it</li>
<li>Move towards a randomly selected exit and use it</li>
<li>Interact with shops</li>
<li>Die</li>
<li>Repeat infinitely</li>
</ul>
<p>The tester tries to mimic an actual gameplay and only teleports when needed (since I haven&rsquo;t implemented a proper path finding algorithm).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not smart enough to win the game on its own, but it is robust enough to consistently making to the first boss and occasionally winning. When I really need it to make it to the end, I&rsquo;ll just lock its health so it can power through.</p>
<p>Autopanic is an absurd project for a solo developer if I&rsquo;m being honest. Some design choices intentionally adds burden to the  system, zero load screen and no cut policy isn&rsquo;t something I&rsquo;d recommend trying without proper experience, but that&rsquo;s where I am right now. So the deployment of automated tester really helped a lot, and has since helped me with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuously sanity checking the healthiness of the code base and the overall performance</li>
<li>Infinite retrying to help identify rare bugs</li>
<li>A quick validation of the overall game balance</li>
<li>A quick method to generate believable gameplay and screenshots without me having to play</li>
</ul>
<p>Automated testing is basically free quality assurance workforce. I think small developers will benefit a lot from deploying one.</p>
