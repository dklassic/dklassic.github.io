Enemy Within üîóI made a small game about card. Quickly hacked together nice looking setup with HDRP example scene and had some physics fun.
Taipei Bus Rush üîóThere‚Äôs this long running joke about bus drivers are driving as if they‚Äôre racing in Taipei.</div>

              <div class="summary">The Lack of Level Design üîóI‚Äôm quite inspired by Oskar St√•lberg‚Äôs work on Bad North, and I remember seeing him mentioning the level design.
Can‚Äôt remember the exact quote and I forgot which tweet does it come from, but I think it is something like this:
Every randomly generated level is a valid test of player‚Äôs combat skill
It was a tweet about how WFC can be easily utilized in a combat-focused game but not so much in a puzzle game.</div>

As my levels becomes more dynamic, managing NavMesh becomes a tedious work NavMeshAgent can reliably move towards the destination, but also costs too much to request frequently My gameplay is very fast-paced, so I‚Äôd like my enemies to react to player action as fast as possible So I decided to move to a custom solution that is basically about picking a preferred direction and move forward.</div>

So I need a custom UI framework.
Inspired by Phi Dinh‚Äôs Recompile, I figure a fully text-based UI would be great for my project. Although I‚Äôm incapable to do fancy ASCII animation and having to support Chinese characters by default (‚Äòcause, I speak Mandarin) removes quite a lot of presentation choices, limiting myself can help me focus more on actual useful stuffs.</div>

But I‚Äôm much wiser now, armed with some actual proper game development knowledge and starting to get a grip of what Unity can do properly.
By what Unity can do, I mean it can‚Äôt do anything. So no more hacking with existing solutions, I must get my hands dirty and start building reliable stuffs.</div>

Then I tried an ambient occlusion heavy visual that focuses on color palette swapping. Which almost stayed till the end.
But then the level geometry increased around this time, so I tried my hand at decorating the levels with Unity Particle System.</div>

So I tried my hand at writing one such algorithm over several attempts with some success.
Then I proceed to scrap the idea of using WFC.
The reason being although I‚Äôm starting to generate some unique geometry (as in not seem like tiles), they never hit any sense of meaningfulness in visual.</div>

I thought to myself that a game about clearing hordes is not going to sell in 2020, which is later proven wrong by recent success of Vampire survivor. (Had some fun revisiting this idea, but that‚Äôs for later)
And my initial design revolves around player having an ability to run faster than enemies, which of course makes player completely invincible.</div>

The game is supposed to be about recurring challenge, with some bosses as checkpoints that grant you permanent upgrades.
This is also when the ‚ÄúFully Diegetic‚Äù idea started to kick off. I want players to have a companion commenting on their every defeat (which I didn‚Äôt know Hades do this back then), and by defeat, being actually dead.</div>

And made a Reddit post to brag about it.
I also accidentally let the projectiles knockback my shooter enemy, resulting in some cool Shoot &amp; Retreat moment.
I think to myself, wow, seven days and it is already fun.</div>
