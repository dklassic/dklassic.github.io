Last Updated April 3, 2023: Here are answers to frequently asked questions about my first game, Autopanic!
What isÂ Autopanic? ðŸ”—Autopanic is fully diegetic twinstick shooter with rogue-like elements in which you need to follow the guidance of an AI to reach the top floor of a mysteries facility. Autopanic aims to deliver some interesting narrative design along with satisfying fast-paced combat.
Rogue-like elements will provide some variance during gameplay and you need to fully learn the mechanics to make it to the end.</description>

Anyways after wrapping up some core pillars of Autopanic in May 2022, I decided to take a look at this phenomenal game called Vampire Survivor that stormed the internet.</description>
